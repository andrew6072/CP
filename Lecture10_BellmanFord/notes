Bellman-Ford just relaxes all the edges in an arbitrary order
(this is one iteration of Bellman-Ford). In the first iteration,
we find the correct distance for all the nodes whose shortest paths f
rom the source have 1 edge. In the next iteration, we find the correct
distances for all the nodes whose shortest paths from the source have
2 edges, and so on. If the shortest path with the most edges has k edges,
we need k iterations of Bellman Ford. Of course, we do not know what "k" is
in advance, but, since shortest paths never repeat nodes
(assuming there are no negative cycles), what we know for sure is that any
shortest path will have at most V-1 edges (in the case where it goes through every node).
This is why V-1 iterations is ALWAYS enough, but often not necessary.
If in one iteration of Bellman-Ford no relaxation yields any improvement,
it means that we already found all shortest paths and we can finish.
